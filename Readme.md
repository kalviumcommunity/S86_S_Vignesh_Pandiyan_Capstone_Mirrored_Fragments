# 🧾 Project Title: Mirrored-Fragments

_A Narrative-Driven Emotional RPG_

---

## 📘 Project Overview

**Mirrored-Fragments** is a web-based, choice-driven RPG that focuses on the emotional and psychological journey of a young protagonist facing the pressures of academic life, personal expectations, and internal self-doubt.  
The game’s core mechanic revolves around making meaningful choices that affect emotional stats like **Confidence**, **Focus**, **Willpower**, and **Anxiety**. Players experience battles against symbolic _inner demons_ representing mental barriers such as procrastination, fear, or insecurity.  
This is not just a game about winning — it's a reflection of how we grow by confronting the parts of ourselves we usually avoid.

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Day 1 | 🔹 Low-Fidelity Design & Basic Logic Setup        | - Design low-fidelity wireframes in Figma (basic layout, UI structure)<br>- Finalize emotional stats system & core game mechanics<br>- Plan branching story and modular scene logic |
| Day 2 | 🔸 High-Fidelity Design & Frontend Implementation | - Convert low-fidelity to high-fidelity UI in Figma<br>- Begin implementing basic layout in React                                                                                   |
| Day 3 | ⚔️ Plan Game Mechanics & Backend Integration      | - Set up GitHub repository and folder structure<br>- Connect frontend to backend<br>- Push code regularly to GitHub, maintain clean commits                                         |
